# BACnet B-SA (Smart Actuator) - C++ example

A minimal, copy-paste-friendly example showing how to implement the BACnet
**B-SA (BACnet Smart Actuator)** device profile in C++ using the
[CAS BACnet Stack](https://store.chipkin.com/services/stacks/bacnet-stack).
It listens on **BACnet/IP (UDP 47808)**, answers **ReadProperty** requests,
accepts **WriteProperty** to its commandable outputs, and is discoverable via
**Who-Is / I-Am**.

## What is the B-SA (Smart Actuator) profile?

**B-SA (BACnet Smart Actuator)**, defined in Annex L of ANSI/ASHRAE 135, is the
next step up from the Smart Sensor - the standard describes it as *"a simple
actuating device with very limited resources."* It is meant for inexpensive,
fixed-function actuators (a valve, a damper, a relay, a setpoint) that need to
**report state** and **be driven** by a controller.

A B-SA device answers **ReadProperty** and accepts **WriteProperty** to its
commandable outputs - that is what distinguishes an actuator from a sensor. It
does not have to support **alarming / event reporting**, **scheduling**, or
**trending**, and this example implements none of them on purpose.

**But it is still a full BACnet device.** Even the simplest profile must present
the standard object model - a **Device** object, a **Network Port** object (every
device needs one), and its objects - and each object must expose all of its
**required properties**. The CAS BACnet Stack generates most of those
automatically (Object_Identifier, Object_Type, Status_Flags, Object_List,
Protocol_*, ...); this example supplies the handful that are
application-specific. The result is conformant for **Protocol_Revision 24**.
[docs/PICS.md](docs/PICS.md) lists every property and who answers it.

## Commandable outputs (the heart of B-SA)

A BACnet output object's `Present_Value` is not written directly. Instead it is
**commandable**: it is resolved from a 16-slot **`Priority_Array`** plus a
**`Relinquish_Default`**.

- A `WriteProperty(Present_Value, value, priority)` stores `value` in slot
  `priority` (1 = highest .. 16 = lowest). If the client omits the priority,
  BACnet uses 16.
- A `WriteProperty(Present_Value, NULL, priority)` **relinquishes** that slot.
- The stack reports the value in the **highest-priority non-null slot** as the
  effective `Present_Value`; if every slot is null, it reports
  `Relinquish_Default`.

This lets several controllers command the same output at different priorities
(e.g. a manual override at priority 8 beats a normal command at 16) and cleanly
hand control back by writing NULL. The application just stores the array (see the
`Commandable` struct in `main.cpp`); the stack does the priority resolution.

## The device this example creates

```
Device 389002  "Rainbow"   (Vendor 389 - Chipkin Automation Systems)
    │
    ├── Analog Input  1       "Bronze"      Present_Value  21.5    (REAL, degrees Celsius; read-only)
    ├── Binary Input  1       "Emerald"     Present_Value  inactive  (0 = inactive / 1 = active; read-only)
    ├── Multi-State Input 1   "Hot Pink"    Present_Value  1       (state, 1..3; read-only)
    ├── Analog Output 1       "Chartreuse"  Present_Value  20.0    (REAL setpoint; WRITABLE, commandable)
    ├── Binary Output 1       "Fuchsia"     Present_Value  inactive  (0/1; WRITABLE, commandable)
    ├── Multi-State Output 1  "Indigo"      Present_Value  1       (state, 1..3; WRITABLE, commandable)
    └── Network Port 1        "Vermilion"   the BACnet/IP port     (required on every device)
```

The three **input** objects (Bronze, Emerald, Hot Pink) are the shared minimum
every example in this series carries. The three **output** objects (Chartreuse,
Fuchsia, Indigo) are the B-SA additions; their `Present_Value` starts at the
`Relinquish_Default` (no slots commanded yet). Object names follow this series'
colour-naming convention (Device is always "Rainbow").

## What this example supports

The example implements exactly the capabilities below - and nothing more, which
is the point of a profile example.

### BIBBs (BACnet Interoperability Building Blocks)

| BIBB | Description | Supported |
|------|-------------|:---------:|
| DS-RP-B | Data Sharing - ReadProperty - B | ✅ |
| DS-WP-B | Data Sharing - WriteProperty - B | ✅ |
| DM-DDB-B | Device Management - Dynamic Device Binding - B | ✅ |
| DM-DOB-B | Device Management - Dynamic Object Binding - B | ✅ |

### Services (executed / B-side)

| Service | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| ReadProperty | Responds to property reads (DS-RP-B). |
| WriteProperty | Accepts writes to the commandable outputs' Present_Value (DS-WP-B). |
| Who-Is / I-Am | Answers Who-Is with I-Am, and broadcasts an I-Am on start-up (DM-DDB-B). |
| Who-Has / I-Have | Answers Who-Has with I-Have (DM-DOB-B). |

### Object types

| Object type | Instance | Name | Access |
|-------------|:--------:|------|--------|
| Device | 389002 | Rainbow | - |
| Analog Input | 1 | Bronze | read-only |

| Network Port | 1 | Vermilion | - |

Every required property of every object, and who answers it, is in
[docs/PICS.md](docs/PICS.md).

## Requires the CAS BACnet Stack (licensed product)

This example **builds against the CAS BACnet Stack, which is a commercial Chipkin
product** - it is not free or open source, and there is no public/trial build.
The stack is referenced here as the **private** git submodule
`submodules/cas-bacnet-stack`; you can only fetch and build it once you have a CAS
BACnet Stack license and access to that repository.

**To get the CAS BACnet Stack (and access to build this example), contact
Chipkin:** <https://store.chipkin.com/services/stacks/bacnet-stack> or
sales@chipkin.com.

You do not need a stack licence to *read* this example, or to run a
[prebuilt release binary](https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-SA-CPP/releases).
The licence is what lets you *build* it - that is the part the stack submodule
gates.

## What's in this repository

This is a **self-contained** project. It ships:

- `main.cpp` - the example device.
- `common/` - the shared helper (UDP, callbacks, CLI, keyboard) vendored in.
- `CMakeLists.txt` - the build, the same on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- `docs/PICS.md` - the conformance statement.
- `submodules/cas-bacnet-stack/` - the **CAS BACnet Stack as a git submodule**
  (private; requires a license - see above). Its sources are compiled into the
  executable, so there is no library or DLL to build, ship, or install.

## Prerequisites

- A C++17 compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang).
- CMake >= 3.15.
- Git (to fetch the stack submodule).

### Windows

- **C++ compiler** - install
  [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  (free) and select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.
- **CMake** - from <https://cmake.org/download/>, or `winget install Kitware.CMake`.

### Linux / macOS

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential cmake git`
- macOS: `xcode-select --install` and `brew install cmake`

## Build

CMake only, and the same two commands on every platform:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-SA-CPP.git
cd BACnetProfileExample-B-SA-CPP

cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Already cloned without `--recursive`? Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
first - the build needs the stack submodule.

> **The first build takes a few minutes** - it compiles the entire CAS BACnet
> Stack (~600 source files) into the executable. Rebuilds after that are
> incremental and take seconds.

If your CAS BACnet Stack lives somewhere other than the bundled submodule, point
CMake at it: `cmake -B build -S . -D CAS_STACK_DIR=/path/to/cas-bacnet-stack`.

## Run

```bash
# Linux / macOS
./build/BACnetExampleBSA

# Windows
.\build\Release\BACnetExampleBSA.exe
```

Expected output:

```
BACnet B-SA (Smart Actuator) Example - C++ v1.2.0
CAS BACnet Stack version: 6.0.21.0
Common helper (common/) version: 2.5.0
FYI: Listening for BACnet/IP on UDP port 47808 (Network Port 1).
TX 21 bytes to 192.168.3.255:47808 (broadcast) (Network Port 1)
FYI: Device 389002 ("Rainbow") ready. Vendor ID 389. Press 'h' for help.
```

The `TX` line is the start-up I-Am the device broadcasts to announce itself. It
goes to the **local subnet broadcast** address (here `192.168.3.255`, computed
from the Network Port's interface), not the global `255.255.255.255`. As clients
talk to the device you'll see `RX ... bytes from ...` and `TX ... bytes to ...`
lines showing the traffic; a WriteProperty to an output also prints a line such
as `WriteProperty: Analog Output 1 (Chartreuse) <- 42.50 @ priority 8`.

The device listens on UDP **47808** (BACnet/IP). Allow that port through your
firewall. To use a different port, pass `--port` (see below).

> **A wall of red `Error:` lines at start-up is expected and is not your bug** -
> it is the stack's own debug logging (the device hearing its own broadcast I-Am,
> and a one-time BACnet/SC UUID notice). [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md#troubleshooting)
> explains both.

### Command-line options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `--port <n>` | `47808` | UDP port to listen on (BACnet/IP). |
| `--deviceID <n>` | `389002` | The device's BACnet instance number (BACnet requires this to be configurable). |
| `--help`, `-h` | - | Show usage and exit. |
| `--version` | - | Print the example, stack, and `common/` helper versions, then exit. |

### Interactive commands

While the example runs, these keys are available:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Show the version information and this command list. |
| `q` | Quit. |
| up arrow | Increase Analog Input 1 (`Bronze`) by 1.1. |
| down arrow | Decrease Analog Input 1 (`Bronze`) by 1.1. |

The up/down keys change the live `Present_Value` of the analog input, so a client
re-reading it sees the new value.

## Verify

Use a BACnet client such as the
[**CAS BACnet Explorer**](https://store.chipkin.com/products/tools/cas-bacnet-explorer):

1. **Discover** - send a **Who-Is**. The device replies with **I-Am** from
   instance **389002** (vendor **389**). It also broadcasts an I-Am at start-up.
2. **Browse the object model** - the device shows eight objects: the Device
   (`Rainbow`), three inputs, three outputs, and the Network Port (`Vermilion`).
   Reading the Device's `Object_List` returns all eight.
3. **Read the Device** - ReadProperty `389002` -> `Object_Name` returns
   `"Rainbow"`; `Protocol_Revision` returns `24`; `Description` returns the
   profile description string.
4. **Read a sensor** - ReadProperty Analog Input `1` -> `Present_Value` returns
   `21.5`; `Units` returns `degrees-Celsius`; `Object_Name` returns `"Bronze"`.
5. **Command an output (the B-SA test)** - ReadProperty Analog Output `1`
   -> `Present_Value` returns `20.0` (its `Relinquish_Default`, nothing commanded
   yet). Now **WriteProperty** Analog Output `1` `Present_Value` = `42.5` at
   priority `8`. Re-read `Present_Value`: it returns `42.5`, and
   `Priority_Array[8]` shows `42.5`. **WriteProperty** `Present_Value` = `NULL`
   at priority `8` to relinquish; `Present_Value` returns to `20.0`. Repeat for
   Binary Output `1` (`"Fuchsia"`, active/inactive) and Multi-State Output `1`
   (`"Indigo"`, state 1..3).
6. **Confirm the profile boundary** - a **WriteProperty** to a read-only *input*
   (e.g. Analog Input 1) is rejected. That is correct: inputs are sensors.

For a property-by-property review against the conformance statement, see
[TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md).
