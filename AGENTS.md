Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. See

[README.md](README.md) first.

## What this project is

A **tutorial** C++ example that implements the BACnet **B-SA (Smart Actuator)**
device profile using the CAS BACnet Stack. It is one of a series - one git repo
per BACnet profile - and builds on the B-SS (Smart Sensor) example by adding
WriteProperty (DS-WP-B) and three commandable output objects. The top priority is
that the code reads like a tutorial a customer can learn from and copy-paste.
Favour clarity over cleverness.

## Layout

This repository is self-contained:

- `main.cpp` - the example device.
- `common/` - the shared helper (vendored).
- `submodules/cas-bacnet-stack/` - the **CAS BACnet Stack** as a git submodule
  (private; compiled from source). After cloning, run
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

## Build

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # once, if not cloned with --recursive
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The first build compiles the whole stack (~600 files) and takes a few minutes;
later incremental builds are fast. Use `-D CAS_STACK_DIR=...` only if your stack
lives outside the bundled submodule.

## Run

```bash
./build/BACnetExampleBSA [--port 47808] [--deviceID 389002]   # Linux/macOS
.\build\Release\BACnetExampleBSA.exe [--port 47808] [--deviceID 389002]   # Windows
```

Interactive keys while running: `h` help, `q` quit, up/down nudge Analog Input 1.

## Conventions

- Device is named "Rainbow"; objects use the series' colour names; vendor id 389.
- Implement **only** the services and objects the B-SA profile requires - but
  expose **every required property** of each object for Protocol_Revision 24.
- Outputs are **commandable**: store the 16-slot `Priority_Array` +
  `Relinquish_Default` in the app (the `Commandable` struct); let the stack
  resolve `Present_Value`. Writes land via the `SetProperty*` callbacks (value)
  and `SetPropertyNull` (relinquish).
- Match the surrounding code style: `const`-correct parameters, check every stack
  return value, keep `main.cpp` linear and well-commented.
- **Never edit `common/` in this repo alone** - it is a vendored copy shared by
  every example in the series, with its own version (`COMMON_VERSION`) and
  changelog (`common/CHANGELOG.md`). To change it: edit, bump the version, add
  a changelog entry, then re-copy `common/` into every example repository.

## How to verify a change

There are no unit tests; verification is behavioural:

1. Build, then run one instance on a clear UDP port.
2. With a BACnet client (e.g. the CAS BACnet Explorer), send **Who-Is** and
   confirm **I-Am** from the device instance.
3. **ReadProperty** every required property of every object and confirm the
   values; confirm `Protocol_Revision` is 24 and `Object_List` lists all objects.
4. **WriteProperty** a commandable output's `Present_Value` at a priority, re-read
   it (and its `Priority_Array`), then write NULL to relinquish and confirm it
   falls back to `Relinquish_Default`. Confirm a write to a read-only input is
   rejected.

## Releasing

Bump `APP_VERSION` in `main.cpp` and add an entry to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md),
then tag `vX.Y.Z`. The GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes the release.
